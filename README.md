We will use this database to get crypto-specific news : [cryptoNewsDataset](https://github.com/soheilrahsaz/cryptoNewsDataset) .

Then, we will extract sentiment based on the methodology presented in this article : [The Ghost in The Machine](https://lelandbybee.com/files/LLM.pdf) by Leland Bybee ([Website](https://lelandbybee.com/)).

The Large Language Model that we will use to extract sentiment is [Mistral AI](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/completion/).
