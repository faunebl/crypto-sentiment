This news suggests that institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, is growing. As more institutional investors gain exposure to these digital assets through ETFs, it could potentially lead to an increase in demand for them. This is especially true in the Australian market, where the new ETFs are being launched, as it may encourage local institutions to invest as well.

However, it's important to note that the impact on Bitcoin's price is uncertain due to numerous factors, such as market sentiment, regulatory changes, and global economic conditions. Therefore, the confidence level in this prediction is fairly high, but not absolute. Additionally, the magnitude of the increase is expected to be moderate, considering that the Australian market represents a smaller share of the global market for Bitcoin and Ethereum."
